# AAAI  2020
The Thirty-Fourth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence was held on **February 7–12th, 2020** in **New York**, New York, USA. The surge in public interest in AI technologies, which we have witnessed over the past few years, continued to accelerate in 2019–2020, with the societal and economic impact of AI becoming a central point of public and government discussion worldwide. AAAI-20 saw submissions and attendance numbers that were records in the history of the AAAI series of conferences and continued its tradition of attracting top-quality papers from all areas of AI. We were excited to see increases in submissions across almost all areas.

The AAAI-20 program consisted of a core technical program of original research presentations, including a special track on AI for social impact and a sister conference track. It additionally featured a broad range of tutorials, workshops, invited talks, panels, student abstracts, a debate, and presentations by senior members. The program was rounded out by technical demonstrations, exhibits, an AI job fair, the AI in Practice program, a student outreach program, and a game night. The conference also continued its tradition of colocating with the long-running IAAI conference and the EAAI symposium, as well as the newer conference on AI, Ethics, and Society.
