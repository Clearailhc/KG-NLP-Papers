# ICDE 2020
The safety and well-being of all conference participants is our priority. After evaluating the current COVID-19 situation, the decision has been made to transform the in-person component of ICDE 2020 into an **all-digital** conference experience – ICDE 2020 will now be an online event. Therefore, ICDE 2020 will no longer take place in Dallas, Texas and will instead take place virtually. The conference will not be postponed as previously communicated and the dates remain the same – **20-24 April**. Proceedings will not be cancelled, and publications will continue as planned.
